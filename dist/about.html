          <h4>My motivation</h4>
          <p>I started learning on January and since then there was not a single day I didn't write some code. I spend about 3-4 hours in average every day learning, practicing and studying how to code and program. My main source is Udemy.com and in addition I keep practicing on Codecademy, FreeCodeCamp and from Youtube videos. I can honestly say that I love to code!</p>
          <p>I would not say about myself that I am a born problem solver but when it comes to coding I cannot stop until I figure out why something does not work the way I want it.</p>
